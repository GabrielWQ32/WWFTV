    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Greta Gerwig (b. 1983) grew up in Sacramento, California, and began her career as an actor in the offbeat “mumblecore” film movement, starring in indie hits like <em>Nights and Weekends</em> and <em>Hannah Takes the Stairs</em>. Her naturalistic performances led her to co-write and direct her own films, showcasing a distinct voice focused on personal growth and female perspectives.

      Gerwig’s solo directorial debut, <em>Lady Bird</em> (2017), drew from her Sacramento upbringing to craft a coming-of-age story that resonated worldwide. Her keen eye for authenticity and detail earned her acclaim as one of the leading writer-directors of her generation.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Lady Bird</em> premiered at Sundance and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, making Gerwig the fifth woman to be nominated for the latter. She followed with her adaptation of <em>Little Women</em> (2019), earning another Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for her fresh, faithful reimagining of the classic novel.
