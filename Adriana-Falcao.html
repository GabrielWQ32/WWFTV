    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Born in 1960 in Recife, Brazil, Adriana Falcão grew up surrounded by the vibrant contradictions of northeastern Brazilian life—colonial architecture, sun‑bleached alleys, stark economic disparities and rich folklore. The daughter of a psychiatrist and a professor of literature, she was immersed from childhood in both the sciences of the mind and the power of stories. By her teenage years she was penning short fables for local newspapers and sketching comic sequences inspired by carnival revelers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After earning a degree in Portuguese and Comparative Literature from the Federal University of Pernambuco, Falcão moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1983 to pursue journalism. She wrote for <em>O Globo</em> and <em>Veja</em>, producing incisive cultural criticism and human‑interest profiles. In 1987 she joined TV Globo as a researcher, quickly distinguishing herself with her flair for narrative structure and her empathy for ordinary Brazilians. Collaborators recall her insistence on blending humor with pathos, capturing the full spectrum of daily life on and off the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 1990s, Falcão transitioned to screenwriting under the mentorship of telenovela legends such as Gilberto Braga and Manoel Carlos. She co‑wrote the beloved primetime series <em>A Grande Família</em>, honing her gift for crafting characters whose small‑town quirks and domestic dramas resonated across socioeconomic divides. Her episodes became known for unexpected lyrical flourishes—poetic interludes, sudden flights of magical realism—and for dialogue that balanced comedic timing with heartfelt sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the late 1990s, Adriana was head writer on <em>O Auto da Compadecida</em>, a landmark miniseries adaptation of Ariano Suassuna’s play. Her screenplay deftly preserved the original’s Northeastern dialects, folkloric imagery, and biting satire of social hypocrisy, while expanding scenes to deepen supporting characters. It earned the International Emmy Award for Best TV Movie/Mini‑Series in 1999, cementing her reputation as a bridge between Brazil’s literary traditions and its booming television industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, Falcão found success in feature films. Her 2003 screenplay for <em>O Homem que Copiava</em> (“The Man Who Copied”) wove together neo‑noir caper conventions with an urban fairy tale about an obsessive photocopier operator in Porto Alegre. Praised for its inventive structure and tender humor, the film won Best Screenplay at the Gramado Film Festival. In subsequent years, she worked across genres—romantic comedies, political satires, children’s adventures—always infusing her scripts with vivid sense of place, complex female perspectives, and a touch of the fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside her screen work, Adriana Falcão has published six novels, three short‑story collections, and two volumes of essays. Her literary voice, like her screenwriting, blends sharp social observation with lyrical flourishes. She’s taught screenwriting workshops at the Rio de Janeiro Film Academy and lectured on Latin American narrative at Harvard University’s Summer School. In 2015 she was awarded the Ordem do Mérito Cultural by Brazil’s Ministry of Culture for her contributions to national storytelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, Falcão has spearheaded collaborative projects across media. She co‑founded “Canal da Imaginação,” an online platform pairing established authors with comic‑book artists to adapt Brazilian myths into graphic novels; and served as creative director for the Rio de Janeiro Biennial of Contemporary Art’s video program. Though her career spans four decades, Adriana’s voice remains fresh—rooted in regional specificity but speaking to universal questions of identity, memory, and human resilience.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>A Grande Família</strong> (1999–2007)  
      As co‑creator and head writer, Falcão shaped over 200 episodes of this beloved sitcom about a working‑class family in Rio. She injected each installment with rapid‑fire dialogue, affectionate satire of Brazilian middle‑class mores, and moments of genuine warmth. Under her stewardship, the show became a national touchstone, winning multiple Prêmio Contigo! de TV awards and influencing generations of comedy writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>O Auto da Compadecida</strong> (1999)  
      Falcão’s adaptation preserved Ariano Suassuna’s blend of medieval pageantry, Catholic allegory, and Northeastern humor. Her screenplay expanded the roles of secondary characters—like the Scheming Baker and the Devout Soldier—giving the story greater emotional resonance without diluting its satirical edge. The miniseries remains a benchmark of Brazilian television, studied in screenwriting courses for its elegant weaving of regional dialect, fantasy, and social critique.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>O Homem que Copiava</strong> (2003)  
      This feature film introduced audiences to André, an introverted photocopy shop clerk who dreams up a bank‑heist scheme to win a classmate’s affection. Falcão’s screenplay merges gritty urban realism—rain‑soaked streets, cramped apartments—with whimsical narration and a non‑linear structure. Critics lauded her for maintaining narrative suspense while infusing the story with sharp observations about class disparity and youthful longing. The film’s success at Gramado and Curitiba festivals showcased Falcão’s versatility beyond television.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Se Eu Fosse Você</strong> (2006)  
      Co‑written by Falcão, this body‑swap romantic comedy became one of Brazil’s highest‑grossing films. The script’s conceit—husband and wife exchanging bodies—allowed Falcão to explore gender roles, marital conflict, and empathy through comedic scenarios. Her tight plotting and emotional depth helped the film earn Best Screenplay at the Festival do Rio and launch a successful sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Canal da Imaginação</strong> (2017– )  
      As co‑founder and creative director, Falcão oversees the adaptation of regional folklore—stories of Saci, Curupira, and Iara—into graphic‑novel form. She commissions writers and artists to collaborate on scripts that honor the oral tradition’s cadence while making it accessible to modern readers. The series has won the HQ Mix Award for Best National Graphic Novel and reinvigorated interest in Brazil’s mythic heritage.

      • <em>Banquete no Inferno</em> (2012), a short‑story collection blending magical realism with sharp social satire.  
      • <em>Diário de um Basbaque</em> (2016), an essay collection on travel, cinema, and the immigrant experience.
