    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Amy M. Homes was born in 1961 in Washington, D.C.  She grew up in New York City and attended Bennington College, where she studied literature and creative writing.  In 1989, at the age of 28, she published her first short‐story collection, <em>Music for Torching</em>, which stunned readers and critics alike with its unflinching look at suburban malaise and fractured family dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Homes divided her time between fiction and teaching.  Her novels <em>Jack</em> (1990) and <em>In a Country of Mothers</em> (1993) cemented her reputation for psychological precision and sharp social observation.  By the late ’90s she began adapting her own work for the screen, writing her first feature screenplay for <em>Flawless</em> (1999), starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010, Homes joined the faculty of Yale University’s MFA program, where she mentors a new generation of writers.  She has remained active in both literary and television circles, publishing award‐winning novels while writing for high‑profile projects on HBO and Netflix.
    </p>

    <h2>Themes &amp; Style</h2>
    <p>
      Homes is renowned for her piercing explorations of memory, trauma, and family secrets.  Her style blends dark humor with emotional rawness: her protagonists are often ordinary people pushed to the brink by events both intimate and absurd.  Critics praise her elegant prose—precise, spare, and often startling in its revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recurring motifs in her work include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suburban disquiet:</strong> ordinary neighborhoods harboring dark undercurrents.</li>
        <li><strong>Unreliable memory:</strong> characters whose recollections are colored by shame or loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> sudden, sometimes violent shifts in identity or circumstance.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Music for Torching</em> (1989) – her debut collection of interlinked stories, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize and announced a bold new voice in American fiction.<br>
      <em>Jack</em> (1990) – a coming‑of‑age novel exploring adolescent grief; adapted into a 1996 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola.<br>
      <em>In a Country of Mothers</em> (1993) – finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, this novel examines a college professor’s breakdown and the ripple effects on her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2018, Homes wrote and produced <em>The Tale</em> for HBO, a memoir‐based film starring Laura Dern.  The screenplay earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Television Movie, and Dern won an Emmy for her performance.  Her ability to translate searingly personal material to the screen has inspired other writers to tackle autobiographical subjects with candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Homes’s influence extends beyond her own books and scripts: she has lectured at major universities, edited anthologies of American short fiction, and served on juries for the National Book Critics Circle.  Her work continues to challenge readers and viewers to confront uncomfortable truths, proving that literature and film can both be powerful sites of empathy and social critique.
