        The 2010s ushered in a new era of serialized storytelling, streaming platforms, and blockbuster franchises, all while women screenwriters continued to break barriers. From breakout indie voices to expansive cinematic universes, female writers reshaped narratives around identity, gender, and global perspectives. This decade saw an unprecedented number of women at the helm of major projects across film and television, creating work that resonated with diverse audiences. Below, we explore the defining contributions of women scriptwriters throughout the 2010s.

      <strong>Film: Indie Queens and Franchise Architects</strong>

        Phoebe Waller-Bridge exploded onto the scene with her 2016 debut feature <em>Pill</em>, but it was her TV work on <em>Fleabag</em> that catapulted her into global acclaim. In film, her 2019 co-writing on <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> brought a female-infused perspective to the Star Wars universe, showcasing how women could contribute to blockbuster franchises. Though uncredited polish, her narrative instincts shaped character-driven moments within the sprawling saga.

        Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut, <em>Lady Bird</em> (2017), earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical script captured teenage yearning and mother-daughter dynamics with authenticity, launching her as a leading voice in indie cinema. Gerwig followed with <em>Little Women</em> (2019), adapting Louisa May Alcott’s classic into a structure that foregrounded female creativity and agency across multiple timelines.

      <p>
        Jordan Peele’s transition from comedian to filmmaker included co-writing contributions from women writers such as Chelsea Peretti (early drafts) on <em>Get Out</em> (2017). Women like Peretti and Ariel Kleiman collaborated in the writers’ rooms, blending horror, satire, and social commentary to redefine the genre with a distinctly female-informed lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emerald Fennell wrote and directed <em>Promising Young Woman</em> (2020), with much of the development in 2018–19. Her razor-sharp script tackled themes of consent and revenge, using genre conventions to confront systemic misogyny. Fennell’s success underscored how women writers could lead bold, provocative filmmaking in the 2010s.
      </p>
      <p>
        In animation, Jennifer Lee co-wrote <em>Frozen</em> (2013) and later co-directed its sequel. Lee’s scripts centered on sisterhood and self-discovery, proving that women could drive stories in major studio animation and redefine Disney’s princess narratives.
      </p>

      <strong>TV: The Streaming Revolution and Prestige Dramas</strong>
      <p>
        The 2010s saw the rise of streaming platforms commissioning original series. Shonda Rhimes continued to expand her empire with <em>How to Get Away with Murder</em> (2014–20), created by Rhimes with early scripts by women like Krista Vernoff. Vernoff’s writing evolved into <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> seasons as showrunner, demonstrating women’s leadership in high-pressure TV production environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s BAFTA-winning <em>Fleabag</em> (2016–19) exemplified female-authored storytelling on streaming. Waller-Bridge wrote every episode, blending dark humor, direct address, and frank explorations of female sexuality. Her success on Amazon Prime Video proved that intimate, female-driven narratives could thrive on new platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Michaela Coel’s semi-autobiographical limited series <em>I May Destroy You</em> (2020) showcased her writing and starring talents, with much of the writing process in 2018–19. Coel’s unflinching portrayal of consent and trauma set new standards for authenticity and creative control by women in TV.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s influence extended to writers like Sally Wainwright, whose <em>Happy Valley</em> (2014–) featured scripts that foregrounded complex female detectives grappling with social issues. The success of these shows on BBC and Netflix highlighted global demand for women’s narratives in crime drama.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jill Soloway’s <em>Transparent</em> (2014–19) disrupted gender norms and narrative form. As creator and lead writer, Soloway brought an intersectional feminist lens to Amazon’s first big drama hit, proving that streaming series could tackle LGBTQ+ themes with nuance and depth.

      <strong>Industry Shifts and Future Directions</strong>

        The 2010s introduced the inclusion rider conversation and equity pledges in Hollywood, championed by actresses-turned-producers who insisted on gender and racial parity in writers’ rooms. Organizations like Time’s Up and the WGA’s diversity committees drove initiatives to increase women’s representation behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online platforms and social media also democratized how writers connected with audiences. Women like Issa Rae parlayed web series success (<em>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em>, 2011) into HBO’s <em>Insecure</em> (2016–21), writing and producing scripts that spoke to Black female millennials. Rae’s trajectory epitomized the era’s new pathways for women to create, fund, and distribute their work.
      </p>

      <strong>Legacy and Beyond</strong>
      <p>
        By decade’s end, women screenwriters had reshaped film and TV industries, establishing new standards for representation, creative control, and genre innovation. Their work in the 2010s laid the foundation for the evolving streaming landscape, ensuring that diverse female voices would continue to lead narrative frontiers in the 2020s and beyond.
