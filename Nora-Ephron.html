    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Nora Ephron (1941–2012) began her career as a journalist and essayist, writing for <em>The New York Post</em> and <em>Esquire</em> with her trademark wit and keen observations on modern life. In the late 1970s, she moved to Hollywood, co‑writing the screenplay for Billy Crystal’s debut film <em>When Harry Met Sally…</em> (1989), which she later directed. Ephron’s background in journalism infused her scripts with sharp dialogue, relatable characters, and an eye for the humor and heartbreak of everyday relationships.

    <p>
      Over the course of her career, Ephron wrote and directed a string of beloved romantic comedies, becoming one of the few women in Hollywood to hold both title roles. Her career was marked by an ability to balance commercial success with personal storytelling, often drawing from her own experiences to create authentic and emotionally resonant films.

      Ephron’s first directorial effort, <em>Heartburn</em> (1986), was adapted from her own best‑selling memoir. She achieved her greatest acclaim with <em>When Harry Met Sally…</em> (1989), earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. She followed with hits like <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> (1993) and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> (1998), films celebrated for their clever banter and heartfelt exploration of love and connection.

      Beyond her screen work, Ephron authored numerous essay collections—<em>I Feel Bad About My Neck</em> (2006) and <em>Everything Is Copy</em> (2010)—in which she chronicled her life with humor and candor. Her influence endures in the countless romantic comedies that followed, and in the generations of women writers and directors she inspired to tell stories with both wit and warmth.
