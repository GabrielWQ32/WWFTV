    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Aisling Bea (born Aisling Clíodhnadh O’Sullivan, 1984) grew up in Kildare, Ireland, in a household where literature and performance were woven into everyday life. Her father, Kevin O’Sullivan, is a poet and teacher, and her mother, Bernie Gallagher, a primary‑school principal. From a young age, Bea immersed herself in storytelling—writing plays for her siblings, performing stand‑up routines in the family living room, and devouring the works of James Joyce and Edna O’Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bea’s early education at Trinity College Dublin included studies in French and philosophy, where she honed her analytical mind and classical literacy. Yet it was comedy and theater that called to her: she joined the Trinity Players, writing and performing sketches that combined sharp social observation with whimsical absurdity. After graduating in 2005, Bea moved to London to pursue stand‑up comedy, quickly earning acclaim on the UK circuit for her self‑deprecating wit and warm stage presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transitioning from stand‑up to screenwriting, Bea enrolled in the UK’s prestigious BFI Network Talent Campus, where she developed her first TV pilot, <em>Green Acres</em>, a dark comedy about rural life in Ireland. Though it was not commissioned, the script won the SCRIPTed Festival Award for Best Comedy Pilot (2011), showcasing Bea’s talent for blending character‑driven humor with poignant emotional insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, Bea co‑created and co‑wrote the comedy‑drama <em>Living with Yourself</em> (Netflix, 2019) alongside Timothy Greenberg. Starring Paul Rudd, the series explores identity and self‑worth through a comedic sci‑fi premise—a man cloned to improve his life. Bea’s contribution to the scripts infused the show with nuanced examinations of relationships and self‑perception, earning her a Writers Guild of America nomination for Outstanding New Series.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside her writing career, Bea continued to perform: she acted in and wrote for the semi‑autobiographical sitcom <em>This Way Up</em> (Channel 4/HBO, 2019– ), which she created with Sharon Horgan. The series, about a young woman recovering from a nervous breakdown, blends humor with mental‑health advocacy. Bea’s scripts are lauded for their authenticity—drawing on her own experiences—and for balancing laughter with empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bea has appeared as a guest host on <em>Never Mind the Buzzcocks</em> and as a commentator on <em>The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice</em>, bringing her writing wit to panel formats. She regularly speaks on storytelling workshops and serves as a mentor for the Comedy Writing Course at the London Film School. In 2022 she was awarded the British Independent Film Award for Best Screenplay for <em>This Way Up</em>, underscoring her skill in crafting character‑centered narratives that resonate widely.

      <strong>This Way Up</strong> (2019– )  
      Co‑created and co‑written by Bea, this comedy‑drama focuses on Aine, a teacher navigating life post‑mental breakdown. Bea’s scripts explore themes of self‑acceptance, friendship, and the complexities of modern adulthood. Her dialogue is celebrated for its naturalism—capturing the hesitations and humor of everyday speech—and for its tender portrayal of mental‑health struggles without reducing them to mere punchlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Living with Yourself</strong> (2019)  
      Bea’s contribution to this genre‑blending series brought emotional depth to its satirical premise. She co‑wrote episodes that examine marital strain, mid‑life angst, and the absurdity of self‑improvement culture. Critics noted the show’s ability to balance speculative comedy with genuine character development, a hallmark of Bea’s writing approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Green Acres</strong> (Pilot, 2011)  
      Bea’s award‑winning pilot, though uncommissioned, is studied in UK scriptwriting courses for its deft fusion of dark humor and rural Irish setting. The script follows a disillusioned urbanite returning to her ancestral farm, grappling with heritage, isolation, and the quirks of small‑town life.

      <strong>Stand‑up & Stage Writing</strong><br>
      • <em>Sparkling Wit</em> (2013), her Edinburgh Fringe solo show, combined autobiographical storytelling with philosophical asides, earning the Edinburgh Comedy Award nomination.<br>
