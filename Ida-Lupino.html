    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Ida Lupino (1918–1995) was born in London into a theatrical family and made her screen debut as a teenager. By the mid‑1940s she had moved to Hollywood, earning acclaim as an actress in films like <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em> (1939) and <em>High Sierra</em> (1941). Frustrated by the limitations placed on actresses, Lupino taught herself screenwriting and directing, breaking ground in a male‑dominated industry.

    <p>
      In 1949 she co‑founded Emerald Productions and became one of the first female directors in Hollywood’s studio era. She often tackled controversial subjects—unwed motherhood, addiction, and rape—in gritty, realistic noir films. Lupino navigated dual careers in front of and behind the camera, forging a path for women storytellers in both fields.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Lupino’s directorial debut, <em>Not Wanted</em> (1949), examined an unmarried woman’s pregnancy with unflinching honesty. She followed with hard‑hitting noirs like <em>The Hitch-Hiker</em> (1953) and <em>Outrage</em> (1950), the latter one of the first American films to address sexual assault. As a writer, she contributed to classics such as <em>They Drive by Night</em> (1940) and the Oscar‑nominated <em>On Dangerous Ground</em> (1952).

    <p>
      Beyond her films, Lupino directed dozens of episodes of pioneering television dramas—<em>The Twilight Zone</em>, <em>Los Angeles</em>—setting a standard for female directors. Her fearless approach to taboo topics and her trailblazing role behind the camera inspired generations of women in film and TV, securing her place as a true pioneer of screen storytelling.
