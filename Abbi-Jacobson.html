    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Abbi Jacobson was born in 1984 in Wayne, Pennsylvania, into a family that embraced creativity and humor. From an early age she exhibited a flair for drawing, storytelling, and performance: sketchbooks filled with comic strips and homemade plays circulated among siblings and friends. She attended Berklee College of Music for a year before transferring to Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), where she earned a BFA in Illustration in 2006. At MICA, Jacobson studied narrative structure, character design, and visual humor—skills that would later infuse her screenwriting with vivid personality and playful insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation she moved to New York City, where she worked as a freelance illustrator and comedy writer, contributing cartoons and essays to publications such as <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>Lucky Peach</em>, and <em>Broadly</em>. Her early work combined deadpan observational humor with an undercurrent of emotional vulnerability, a style that resonated with online audiences. In 2011, she met Ilana Glazer at a rooftop party hosted by a mutual friend; the two discovered a shared sensibility and decided to create a sketch comedy duo. They began writing short videos—absurdist parodies of infomercials, faux self-help segments, and riff-driven dialogues—and posting them to YouTube under the banner “Broad City.”

      The “Broad City” sketches quickly attracted a cult following for their gleeful irreverence, improvisational energy, and frank exploration of female friendship and urban life. Jacobson’s background in illustration surfaced in her meticulous crafting of each scene: she envisioned framing, props, and color palettes with the care of a visual artist, ensuring that every moment reinforced character and tone. In 2013, Amy Poehler’s Paper Kite Productions optioned the concept as a television series for Comedy Central. Jacobson and Glazer co‑wrote every episode of the first five seasons, with Jacobson contributing storylines that blended surreal comedic set‑pieces (a haunted subway car, a dancing hotdog mascot) with emotionally resonant beats (career insecurity, self‑acceptance, relationship dynamics). The show’s success—seven seasons, two Peabody Awards, and multiple Critics’ Choice nominations—cemented Jacobson’s reputation as both a talented writer and an adept actor, playing a version of herself with wry humor and genuine heart.

    <p>
      Beyond “Broad City,” Jacobson has expanded into feature films, children’s literature, and podcasting. In 2019 she made her feature directorial debut co‑writing and starring in <em>Broad City: The Movie</em>, produced by Lionsgate. That same year she release 
      her first middle‑grade novel, <em>Whatever, Linda</em>, illustrated in her own whimsical style and praised for its witty dialogue and empathetic portrayal of adolescent self‑discovery. She also lent her voice to animated series—most notably as the lead in Apple TV+’s <em>Central Park</em> (2020–present)—and hosted the award‑winning interview podcast <em>A Sloppy Love Story</em>, in which she chats candidly with guests about relationships and creativity.

      In interviews and essays, Jacobson speaks passionately about the importance of representation, creative collaboration, and the freedom to experiment. She has taught masterclasses on comedic writing at MICA and served as a guest lecturer at the Sundance Institute’s Screenwriters Lab. Active on social media, she shares behind‑the‑scenes sketches, writing prompts, and insights into her process, inspiring aspiring writers and artists to embrace vulnerability and irreverence in equal measure.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Broad City</strong> (2014–2019)  
      Co‑created, co‑written, and co‑starring Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, “Broad City” chronicles two twenty‑something best friends navigating the absurdities of New York City life. Unlike traditional sitcoms, its structure is loose and improvisational: story arcs emerge from comic set‑pieces and Jacobson’s real‑life experiences—early‑morning yoga classes gone awry, disastrous Craigslist dates, illicit rooftop parties. Critics lauded the show for its groundbreaking portrayal of female friendship free from romantic framing, and its fearless embrace of bodily humor. Jacobson wrote and directed several key episodes—”Mushrooms,” “Bodega Girls,” and the finale “Broad City Finale”—demonstrating her skill in balancing chaos and emotional truth. The show’s legacy is evident in a generation of female‑led comedies that center messy heroines with agency and heart.

      Expanding the series’ universe, Jacobson co‑wrote and starred in the feature adaptation, which follows Abbi and Ilana on their first European vacation. The screenplay retains the show’s sketch‑driven DNA—encountering vanishing Airbnbs, impromptu dance battles, and existential breakdowns—while deepening the characters’ emotional arcs. Jacobson’s direction emphasizes visual comedy and timing, using rapid‑fire montage and dynamic camera movements to capture the whirlwind energy of their trip. The film was praised for faithfully translating the series’ spirit to the big screen.

Jacobson’s writing captures the intensity of preadolescent imagination—every detail of costume, snack table, and dancefloor is rendered with joyful precision. Critics highlighted her ability to shift seamlessly from adult‑oriented humor to age‑appropriate insight, making the novel a hit among both young readers and their parents.
