    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (1927–2013) was born in Cologne, Germany, and emigrated with her family to Britain in 1939. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London before turning to writing. In 1951 she married Indian architect Cyrus Jhabvala and moved to New Delhi, where she began documenting life in post‑colonial India. Her keen eye for cultural nuance and her elegant prose led her to film, where she brought her deep understanding of character and place to the screen.

      In the 1980s, Jhabvala formed a legendary collaboration with director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant. Over the next two decades, she wrote or co‑wrote the screenplays for adaptations of literary classics, seamlessly translating intricate narratives and internal monologues into vivid, dialogue‑driven drama. Her ability to inhabit multiple cultural worlds—European, Indian, and British—gave her scripts a unique sensitivity and depth.
