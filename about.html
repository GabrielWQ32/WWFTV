      <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Anna Weinstein</strong>, a proud Professor of Film &amp; Media Studies at Kennesaw State University. Over the past twenty years, I’ve had the privilege of guiding eager students through the art and history of cinema—unpacking how every cut, every piece of dialogue, and every frame can speak volumes about culture, identity, and our shared humanity.</p>

      <p>My journey began in a small hometown theater, where I first learned that a single spotlight can transform an empty stage into a world of possibility. I went on to earn my MFA in Cinema Studies, diving deep into the archives of silent film and the golden age of Hollywood. With each dusty reel I restored and every classic script I dissected, I became ever more convinced that the stories behind the camera—particularly those written by women—deserve a grander stage.</p>

      <p>This website is the realization of a lifelong dream: to create a living archive for women screenwriters whose voices echo through celluloid history yet often go uncelebrated. From the trailblazers of the 1910s to the visionary writers shaping today’s streaming landscape, I wanted a single place where students, scholars, and cinephiles can explore these remarkable careers—browse their filmographies, discover their influences, and be inspired to write their own stories.</p>

      <p>Building this site has been a labor of love. I spent countless evenings poring over vintage magazines and studio records, securing permissions for rare photographs, and coding interactive elements so that each profile feels like stepping into a miniature museum exhibit. I collaborated with our stellar team of graduate assistants—who taught me as much about responsive design and digital accessibility as I taught them about narrative structure—and together we crafted the timelines, carousels, and spotlight features you see today.</p>

      <p>At Kennesaw State University, I’ve always championed the power of representation in media: seeing screenwriters who look like you or come from worlds unlike yours gives you permission to tell your own story with confidence. This site is more than a reference tool—it’s a rallying cry. It’s an invitation to every student who visits: “Your voice matters. Your story matters. And one day, your work might belong here, too.”</p>

      <p>Finally, my deepest gratitude goes to <em>Kennesaw State University</em> for believing in this vision from day one. Their generous sponsorship covered research fellowships, supported student coders, and allowed us to host community screenings and guest‑speaker events around these women’s films. Without KSU’s unwavering commitment to arts and scholarship, this project would have remained just an idea. Thank you for making this dream a reality.</p>
