    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Jean Kerr (1922–2003) was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and began her career as a stage actress before discovering her true talent for comedy writing. In the early 1950s she moved to New York, contributing humor pieces to magazines like <em>The New Yorker</em> and making her Broadway debut as co‑author of the hit play <em>King of Hearts</em> (1954). Her sparkling wit and keen observations on domestic life quickly made her one of America’s most beloved humorists.

      Kerr transitioned to Hollywood in the late 1950s, penning screenplays that captured her trademark blend of farce and heart. Always fascinated by the absurdities of marriage and family, she drew on her own experiences—particularly as the wife of esteemed critic Walter Kerr—to infuse her scripts with warmth and self‑deprecating humor. Beyond writing, she lectured on comedy craft and mentored rising female writers, championing women’s voices in both theater and film.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Jean Kerr’s most famous stage success, <em>Mary, Mary</em> (1961), remains the longest‑running non‑musical play in Broadway history, showcasing her flair for witty banter and situational comedy. On screen, she wrote the screenplay for <em>Picnic</em> (1955), earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Her sharp dialogue also shone in films like <em>Ride the High Country</em> (1962) and the screwball revival <em>Send Me No Flowers</em> (1964).

      Kerr’s bestselling memoir, <em>Please Don’t Eat the Daisies</em> (1957), offered a hilarious look at motherhood and suburban life, later adapted into a hit film and TV series. Her enduring influence lies in her ability to find comedy in the everyday, paving the way for later writers—particularly women—who blend humor with honesty. Today, her work continues to inspire playwrights and screenwriters seeking to balance laughter with genuine human connection.
