    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Dorothy Parker (1893–1967) was born in New Jersey and rose to fame as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table in 1920s New York City. Her razor‑sharp wit and acerbic verse made her a celebrated poet, critic, and short‑story writer. In 1930, she crossed over to Hollywood, signing with MGM as a screenwriter. There, Parker applied her trademark humor and keen social insight to the silver screen, contributing to scripts that balanced levity with emotional depth.

      Though she faced the challenges of studio politics and the pressures of the Hays Code, Parker’s knack for crafting unforgettable quips and sympathetic characters kept her in demand. Beyond film, she continued to publish acclaimed poetry collections and essays, sustaining her reputation as one of America’s most distinctive voices.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Parker’s most notable screen credit is for the screwball classic <em>A Star Is Born</em> (1954), for which she received an Academy Award nomination alongside husband Alan Campbell. Earlier, she worked uncredited on scripts such as <em>Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman</em> (1947) and contributed dialogue to many MGM comedies. Her poetic collections—<em>Enough Rope</em> (1926) and <em>Sunset Gun</em> (1928)—remain standards of Modernist verse.

      A fierce advocate for civil rights and free expression, Parker was active in the Hollywood Anti‑Nazi League and later blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Her fearless commentary on love, loss, and human folly continues to resonate. Today, Dorothy Parker is remembered not only for her sharp tongue but for revealing the heart beneath the humor—and for proving that a truly memorable line can change a story, and a life, forever.
