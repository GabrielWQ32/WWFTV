    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      A’Ziah “Z” King (b. 1995) was born in East Oakland, California, into a family steeped in both grassroots activism and artistic expression. Her mother, a community organizer, and her father, a jazz musician, instilled in her an early awareness of social justice alongside a deep love of storytelling and music. As a child, King spent afternoons transcribing old scripts and improvising scenes with neighborhood friends—an activity that revealed both her natural flair for dialogue and her fascination with the power of narrative to forge empathy.

    <p>
      King attended the California College of the Arts, where she initially pursued graphic design before switching to film &amp; TV. She graduated summa cum laude in 2017, her thesis short—a vivid, hand‑painted animation exploring generational memory—winning the school’s top prize. During college, she interned at independent Bay Area collective Firelight Pictures, where she assisted on community‑driven documentary projects and began to see film as a tool for cultural preservation and community empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation, King wrote and directed several acclaimed shorts—most notably <em>Oakland Sunday</em> (2018), a vérité‑style portrait of churchgoers and street vendors, and <em>Blue Suns</em> (2019), a lyrical exploration of gentrification in West Oakland through the eyes of teenage poets. Both films premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival and were later acquired by PBS for broadcast. Critics praised King’s ability to marry intimate, character‑driven vignettes with broader social themes: her protagonists speak in the vernacular of their neighborhoods, yet their stories resonate universally.

      King’s leap to feature work came in 2021 with her debut screenplay, <em>Sundown Boulevard</em>, developed in the Sundance Screenwriters Lab. The film follows Elena, a young Black poet returning to Oakland after years on the East Coast, who grapples with inherited trauma, creative block, and the friction between memory and change. King’s script won Sundance’s Sloan Prize for its nuanced portrayal of art and science, and secured financing from the MacArthur Foundation’s “Genius Filmmaker” initiative. Principal photography began in summer 2022 under King’s direction, marking her transition from short‑form to long‑form storytelling.

      Alongside her narrative work, King has become an influential voice in shaping inclusion behind the camera. She co‑founded “Oakland Voices,” a mentorship collective that pairs Bay Area youth with working screenwriters for hands‑on workshops in script development, production design, and editing. Through this program, dozens of young people have seen their micro‑budget shorts screened at local festivals, and several have gone on to film school.

      King writes and speaks frequently on panels about representation in media, arguing that authentic storytelling arises when creators draw deeply on their lived experience rather than an industry template. In 2023 she was invited to teach a masterclass at the American Film Institute, focusing on writing strategies for capturing place and dialect without resorting to caricature. Her essays on intersectionality in screenwriting have appeared in <em>Filmmaker Magazine</em> and <em>Black Camera</em>, cementing her reputation as both a craftsman of narrative and a keen cultural critic.

      Today, A’Ziah King resides in Oakland and is in pre‑production on her second feature, a period drama about two queer sisters navigating family secrets during the 1968 Black Panther era. She continues to mentor emerging filmmakers, serve on advisory boards for regional film funds, and advocate for community‑based cinema that uplifts marginalized voices.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Oakland Sunday</strong> (2018)  
      King’s breakthrough short film, shot over a single Sunday morning, interweaves five vignettes—the florist arranging lilies, the barista experimenting with latte art, the gospel choir rehearsing—to create a chorus of urban life. With no single protagonist, the film’s structure resembles a mosaic, each shard of story reflecting the city’s rhythms and tensions. Winner, Best Short Film at the San Francisco International Film Festival, it was lauded for its minimalist style and emotional depth.

      <strong>Blue Suns</strong> (2019)  
      A poetic documentary capturing teenage spoken‑word artists performing atop graffiti‑tagged rooftops. King’s editing choices—jump cuts between performance and close‑ups of ink‑stained hands—evoke the improvisatory nature of both rap and cinema. The film earned the Golden Gate Award for Documentary Short and ignited conversations about youth expression as a form of resistance to displacement.

      <strong>Sundown Boulevard</strong> (2023)  
      King’s debut feature screenplay, selected by Sundance and funded by major foundations, chronicles Elena’s return to a home transformed by rapid development. The script’s chapters unfold in non‑linear time, mirroring the protagonist’s fractured memory. Dialogue ranges from whispered confessionals to full‑throated slam‑poetry monologues. The screenplay won the Sloan Prize for its poignant integration of poetic form and scientific inquiry (Elena is a neurobiology researcher by training), and is sl
