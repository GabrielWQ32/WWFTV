    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Anita Loos (1888–1981) was born in California and by age 12 was already writing scenarios for local studios. She moved to Los Angeles in 1912 and quickly made her mark as one of Hollywood’s first professional screenwriters. Loos had an uncanny gift for sharp, witty dialogue—so much so that her most famous creation, the flapper heroine of <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>, began life on the page before leaping to Broadway and then film.

      Over the silent era, Loos penned dozens of scripts, often collaborating with directors like D.W. Griffith and Maurice Tourneur. She navigated the transition to sound with ease, writing screenplay after screenplay while also publishing novels and essays. Her household name status allowed her to negotiate unprecedented contracts, solidifying her place as one of the highest‑paid writers of the studio system.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Loos’s breakthrough novel, <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em> (1925), remains a touchstone of American satire and gender commentary. On screen, her adaptation (1928) captured the era’s buoyant energy, and later film versions cemented her heroine, Lorelei Lee, as an icon. Other notable credits include the silent epic <em>Intolerance</em> (1916), and her screenplay for <em>Red Dust</em> (1932), which starred Clark Gable and Jean Harlow.

      Beyond her own scripts, Loos wrote bestselling memoirs—most famously <em>…and Hollywood Too</em>—and helped pave the way for women in both screenwriting and publishing. Her incisive voice and trailblazing career inspired generations of storytellers, proving that wit and wisdom could thrive even in Hollywood’s most glamorous circles.
