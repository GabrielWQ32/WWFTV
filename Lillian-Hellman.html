    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Lillian Hellman (1905–1984) was born in New Orleans and began her writing career as a playwright before transitioning to Hollywood screenwriting in the 1930s. Her first Broadway hit, <em>The Children’s Hour</em> (1934), showcased her gift for tense drama and morally complex characters. Soon after, she moved to California and signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her sharp dialogue and nuanced character work quickly earned her respect in the studio system.

      Hellman’s political convictions also shaped her career: she was an outspoken liberal, using her platform to critique social injustices. During the McCarthy era, she stood firm against subpoenas from the House Un-American Activities Committee, famously refusing to name names. Throughout her life, Hellman balanced her art with activism, writing scripts that challenged audiences to confront uncomfortable truths.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Hellman’s notable screenwriting credits include the film adaptation of her own play <em>Watch on the Rhine</em> (1943), which won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, and the emotionally charged <em>Julia</em> (1977), based on her friendship with Julia {name}. Her play <em>Little Foxes</em> (1939) was adapted to film in 1941 and remains a classic study of greed and family conflict. Throughout her career, Hellman’s work pushed boundaries—both thematically and structurally—earning her a reputation as one of the most daring writers of her generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hellman’s fearless exploration of power, betrayal, and conscience continues to influence playwrights and screenwriters alike. Her insistence on creative integrity and her willingness to tackle taboo subjects paved the way for future generations of women writers in film, theater, and beyond.
