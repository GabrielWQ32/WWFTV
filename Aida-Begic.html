    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Aida Begić was born in 1976 in Sarajevo, then part of Yugoslavia.  She came of age against the backdrop of dramatic social upheaval—her adolescence was marked by the Bosnian War (1992–1995), which indelibly shaped her artistic voice and thematic interests.  After surviving the siege of Sarajevo, Begić pursued film studies at the Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo, graduating in 2000.  There she apprenticed under established Bosnian auteurs, absorbing lessons in visual poetry, narrative resilience, and the power of small gestures to convey large human truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Begić’s early work comprised short films and documentaries that screened across the former Yugoslavia, capturing postwar reconstruction through the eyes of children and families.  Her 2003 student film, <em>Under the Olive Trees</em>, won a local festival award for its tender portrayal of a displaced family rebuilding their life amid ancient groves.  Critics praised her ability to blend documentary realism—shooting on location in war‑scarred villages—with scripted sequences that emphasized silence, landscape, and the emotional weight of quotidian tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2006, Begić co‑founded Direction—a Sarajevo collective dedicated to training young filmmakers in storytelling and cinematographic craft.  She taught directing workshops at the Sarajevo Film Academy and led mobile masterclasses for rural students across Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Her pedagogical style, combining rigorous screenwriting exercises with improvisational scene work, reflected her belief that authentic story emerges from personal experience and communal exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Begić’s feature debut, <em>Snow</em> (2008), premiered at Cannes’ Critics’ Week and won the Grand Prix.  Set in a remote mountain village, the film follows a young schoolteacher striving to keep her one‑room school open as the population dwindles.  Begić’s screenplay interweaves multiple perspectives—children, elders, migrants—revealing how war’s aftermath echoes across generations.  Reviewers lauded her spare, lyrical dialogue and her use of the stark, wintry landscape as a character in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next decade, Begić balanced narrative films with documentaries and short‑form projects.  Her 2012 documentary <em>Crossroads of Memory</em> returned to Sarajevo to interview former child soldiers, weaving archival footage with present‑day testimonies.  The film’s unflinching honesty and compassionate framing won the Best Documentary Award at Sarajevo Film Festival.  In 2014, she directed the feature <em>Beyond the Walls</em>, a social‑realist drama set in postwar suburbs, which tackled themes of displacement, reconciliation, and the resilience of everyday rituals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aida Begić has served on juries at major European festivals (Cannes, Venice, Karlovy Vary) and chaired the Bosnian Directors’ Guild.  In 2016 she was invited as a visiting professor at the European Film College in Denmark, where she developed a curriculum on “Story and Silence in Post‑Conflict Cinema.”  Her essays on navigating ethical representation of trauma in fiction and documentary have been published in <em>Cineaste</em> and the <em>Journal of Balkan Studies</em>, establishing her as a leading voice on film ethics and collective memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, Begić has expanded into international co‑productions, writing and directing <em>Echoes of the River</em> (2019), a Bosnian‑French‑German drama exploring climate change’s impact on a small community.  The film received funding from Eurimages and aired on ARTE, opening in competition at Locarno.  Begić continues to mentor emerging women directors in the Balkans through her “New Horizons” initiative, advocating for gender parity in funding and distribution.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Snow</strong> (2008)  
      Begić’s debut feature immerses viewers in an isolated mountain village where the local teacher, Lejla, fights to keep her school alive.  The screenplay eschews melodrama, instead building empathy through routines—clearing snow, preparing lessons, sharing bread—and subtle character reveals.  Its win at Cannes established Begić as a powerful new voice in European cinema, noted for her humane eye and narrative restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Crossroads of Memory</strong> (2012)  
      This documentary interlaces wartime recollections of former child soldiers with present‑day interviews, reflecting on memory’s fragility.  Begić’s approach—alternating archival Super‑8 footage with static, theater‑style setups—foregrounds the ethical responsibility of representation, highlighting the tension between witnessing and re‑telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Beyond the Walls</strong> (2014)  
      A social‑realist ensemble piece set in postwar Sarajevo’s outskirts, focusing on families returning to bomb‑damaged homes.  Begić’s script balances interwoven vignettes—from a grandmother tending a rooftop garden to a teenager grappling with unemployment—demonstrating her gift for mosaic storytelling and her commitment to amplifying marginalized voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Echoes of the River</strong> (2019)  
      An ecological drama situating a Bosnian‑French co‑production on the banks of the Drina River.  Begić probes how climate shifts disrupt ancestral livelihoods—fishermen, farmers, mill‑workers—while using poetic voice‑overs and fluid camerawork to fuse environmental urgency with human intimacy.  The film’s critical acclaim reaffirms her capacity to bridge local specificity with global themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mosaic of Young Voices</strong> (Short Collaborative Project, 2016)  
      In partnership with five Balkan filmmakers, Begić co‑wrote and co‑directed this anthology of ten‑minute segments depicting youth identity in Kosovo, Montenegro, and Bosnia.  Screened at Sarajevo and Vienna, the project exemplified her advocacy for regional collaboration and cross‑cultural dialogue.
