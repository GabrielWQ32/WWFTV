    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Arlette Varda—known professionally as Agnès Varda—was born May 30, 1928 in Ixelles, Brussels, and raised in Sète on France’s Mediterranean coast. Born to a Greek father and French mother, she grew up bilingual, steeped in photography and visual arts: her father was a photographer, and her mother collected antique picture postcards. Varda studied art history at the École du Louvre in Paris and worked briefly in fashion photography, crafting portraiture that captured both spontaneity and elegance. This dual interest in image and narrative would become the hallmark of her career.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1954, drawn by the creative ferment of postwar Paris, Varda enrolled at the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC), one of the few women in her class. There she mastered the technical craft—editing, cinematography, screenwriting—while forging friendships with future New Wave figures like François Truffaut and Jean‑Luc Godard. In 1955, with no studio backing, she wrote, directed, edited, and self‑financed her debut feature <em>La Pointe Courte</em>, a lyrical study of a fishing village intercut with a troubled Parisian couple. Though little‑seen at the time, today it’s celebrated as a proto–New Wave film for its spontaneous performances, location shooting, and elliptical structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varda next turned to documentary, traveling to her native Sète in 1956 to film <em>Le Bonheur</em> (not to be confused with the later melodrama of the same name). Her ability to blend observational realism with painterly compositions attracted the attention of critics: the cinematographer Jean Rabier recalled her directing with “the eye of a photographer and the soul of a poet.” Over the late 1950s and ’60s she divided her time between fiction—making films like <em>Cléo de 5 à 7</em> (1962), which follows a young singer in near–real time—and documentary projects that explored marginalized communities across France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1967 Varda moved to Los Angeles, where she witnessed the burgeoning independent and countercultural film scene. She became a mentor to American avant‑garde filmmakers, taught at UCLA, and directed short films like <em>Black Panthers</em> (1968), a vérité portrait of the revolutionary group that remains a vital historical document. Returning to France in the early ’70s, she co‑founded the Ciné‑Tamaris collective and pioneered feminist filmmaking, directing <em>One Sings, the Other Doesn’t</em> (1977), a film about female solidarity and reproductive rights that interweaves personal and political narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next four decades Varda continued to innovate, collaborating with artists, sculptors, and musicians. Her 1985 documentary <em>Daguerreotypes</em> examines one Paris street and its shopkeepers in exquisite detail; her 1987 film <em>Jane B. par Agnès V.</em> is an intimate portrait of actress Jane Birkin. In the 1990s she embraced digital video and installation art, mounting exhibitions at the Pompidou Center and collaborating with the photographer JR on the celebrated street‑art project “Visages, Villages” (2017), which she co‑directed at age 89.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tireless experimenter, Varda’s career spanned narrative, documentary, and multimedia installations. She received honorary degrees from Harvard, UC Berkeley, and the London Film School, and lectured widely on cinema as an art of memory and empathy. In 2010 she became the first female “Dame” of France’s highest order, the Légion d’Honneur, and in 2019 won an Academy Honorary Award for her “pioneering spirit” in film. She passed away March 29, 2019, leaving behind a body of work that reshaped the language of cinema.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>La Pointe Courte</strong> (1955)  
      Varda’s first feature interlaces two narratives—a couple’s troubled relationship and the daily life of a fishing village—through montage that breaks with classical continuity. Critics recognize it as a forerunner to the French New Wave, pioneering location sound, nonprofessional actors, and a liberated approach to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cléo de 5 à 7</strong> (1962)  
      Shot in near–real time, the film follows pop singer Cléo as she awaits medical test results. Varda’s use of natural light, street‑corner soundscapes, and direct address to camera creates an immersive psychological portrait. It’s lauded for its feminist undertones and for expanding narrative possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>One Sings, the Other Doesn’t</strong> (1977)  
      A landmark feminist musical drama, this film tracks two friends navigating pregnancy, abortion rights, and creative fulfillment. Varda blends song, documentary‑style interviews, and stylized narrative, underscoring cinema’s capacity to engage activism and art.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vagabond</strong> (1985)  
      Winner of the Golden Lion at Venice, this stark drama portrays a young drifter found frozen in the snow. Varda’s episodic structure and compassionate lens critique social indifference. It’s studied for its blend of neo‑realism and poetic imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Daguerréotypes</strong> (1976)  
      In this 30‑minute documentary, Varda films each inhabitant of her Paris street in close‑up, capturing the texture of everyday life. The work—simultaneously anthropological and lyrical—foreshadowed her later installation art and constitutional concern with place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visages, Villages</strong> (2017)  
      A collaboration with street‑artist JR, this road‑movie documentary traverses rural France, capturing murals and portraits projected onto old buildings. The film won the L’Œil d’Or Documentary Prize at Cannes and introduced Varda to a new generation, exemplifying her lifelong curiosity and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varda’s influence permeates global cinema: she expanded the director’s role to encompass editor, writer, and installation artist; she championed women’s stories long before gender parity movements; she treated documentary as a form of poetic fiction. Film schools teach her methods in visual essay and feminist narrative, and retrospectives at MoMA, TIFF, and the BFI celebrate her work as essential to understanding modern cinematic art.
