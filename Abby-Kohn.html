    <h2>Life &amp; Career</h2>
    <p>
      Abby Kohn was born in 1968 in New York City and grew up immersed in the rhythms of the boroughs, where storytelling spilled from family dinner tables into the streets and subway cars. The daughter of a high‑school English teacher and a jazz pianist, she developed an early love of language paired with a deep appreciation for rhythm and timing. Kohn attended Northwestern University’s School of Communication, where she majored in Radio/Television/Film and wrote for the student sketch troupe. After graduating in 1990, she cut her teeth as a development assistant at Miramax, learning the inner workings of Hollywood script evaluation and production.

    <p>
      In the late 1990s, Kohn met fellow writer Marc Silverstein at a Beverly Hills coffee shop—both were struggling to break in as feature scribes. Recognizing a shared sensibility for romantic comedy and emotional honesty, they began collaborating, trading scenes and polishing each other’s drafts. Their first produced screenplay was <em>Never Been Kissed</em> (1999), co‑written for screen legend Drew Barrymore: a sweet‑nosed high‑school comedy that subtly explored themes of identity and self‑acceptance. Though the writers’ credits were modest, their polished dialogue and deft structure caught the attention of studio executives.

    <p>
      Over the next decade, Kohn and Silverstein’s partnership blossomed into one of the most successful writing duos in romantic comedy. They penned <em>He’s Just Not That Into You</em> (2009), adapting the best‑selling self‑help book into a multi‑threaded ensemble film that wove together overlapping love‑life narratives across Baltimore. The project demanded meticulous plotting—balancing eight protagonists’ arcs—and established their talent for merging comedic tone with genuine emotional stakes. That same year, they co‑wrote and produced <em>Friends with Benefits</em> (2011), a modern riff on screwball conventions starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Its rapid‑fire banter and playful deconstruction of romantic tropes showcased the duo’s trademark voice: warm, witty, and surprisingly introspective.

    <p>
      In 2016, Kohn took on her first solo screenplay credit with <em>How to Be Single</em>, a female‑driven ensemble comedy exploring contemporary dating culture in New York. Based on a novel by Liz Tuccillo, the film centered on single women of different ages and backgrounds discovering autonomy and self‑worth. Kohn’s sharp ear for dialogue and her empathetic treatment of characters’ vulnerabilities earned praise from both critics and audiences. She also co‑created the Netflix series <em>Good on Paper</em> (2021), drawing on personal experiences in the Los Angeles comedy scene to craft a darkly comedic romantic drama.

      Alongside her writing career, Kohn is a dedicated mentor and advocate for female screenwriters. She leads workshops at the Sundance Institute, participates in the WGA’s mentoring program, and frequently guest‑lectures at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts. In interviews she champions storytelling that reflects genuine human complexity, arguing that comedy and drama are two sides of the same coin. Her balanced approach—mixing laugh‑out‑loud moments with quiet reflection—has become a model for new writers seeking to navigate genre boundaries.

    <h2>Major Works &amp; Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Never Been Kissed</strong> (1999) – Kohn’s breakout feature, co‑written with Marc Silverstein, follows an awkward young journalist who reenrolls in high school undercover to report on teen culture. The screenplay’s blend of fish‑out‑of‑water humor and heartfelt coming‑of‑age storytelling earned it a place in the canon of early‑’00s teen comedies. Kohn’s ability to balance broad comedic set‑pieces with moments of genuine vulnerability hinted at the thematic depth she would bring to later work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>He’s Just Not That Into You</strong> (2009) – Adapting the best‑selling relationship advice book, Kohn and Silverstein crafted an intersecting ensemble narrative in which characters learn hard truths about honesty, desire, and self‑respect. The screenplay required juggling multiple storylines—ranging from a married couple drifting apart to a young man misreading every signal—and is studied in screenwriting courses for its structural coordination and tonal shifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Friends with Benefits</strong> (2011) – A modern screwball comedy, the film pairs a dating‑skeptical magazine editor with an earnest photographer, exploring whether sex can truly exist without emotional entanglement. Kohn’s dialogue crackles with urban wit, and she deftly deconstructs genre expectations while delivering genuine character growth. The movie’s success revitalized the romantic‑comedy genre and influenced a wave of ‘post‑romcom’ films that blend romance with frank discussions of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How to Be Single</strong> (2016) – As sole screenwriter, Kohn expanded her voice into a female‑centric ensemble piece. The script centers on young women navigating digital dating, platonic friendships, and societal expectations. Kohn balances comedic vignettes—speed‑dating mishaps, club‑scene escapades—with introspective moments of self‑discovery. The film’s box‑office success and cultural resonance underscored Kohn’s ability to evolve with changing social landscapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Good on Paper</strong> (2021) – Co‑created for Netflix, this dark romantic dramedy leans into Kohn’s penchant for blending humor with biting social critique. Loosely based on stand‑up comedian Iliza Shlesinger’s life, the series explores themes of trust, ambition, and the blurred lines between performance and reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond her produced screenplays, Kohn has sold multiple original spec scripts to major studios—ranging from metafictional comedies to heartfelt family dramas—and continues to develop projects with talent such as Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Amy Adams. Her interviews and podcasts have influenced screenwriters to embrace personal truth and humor as guiding principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abby Kohn’s legacy lies in her consistent ability to infuse the romantic‑comedy form with emotional authenticity, incisive social observation, and a progressive sensibility. She has helped redefine the genre for the 21st century—where laughter and insight walk hand in hand—and her mentorship ensures that future voices will carry forward the torch of honest, character‑driven storytelling.
