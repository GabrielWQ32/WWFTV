      Carrie Fisher (1956–2016) was born in Beverly Hills into a Hollywood family—her parents were Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher—but she carved out her own remarkable path as an actress and writer. At age 19, Fisher burst onto the global stage as Princess Leia Organa in George Lucas’s original <em>Star Wars</em> (1977), instantly becoming an icon of strength, wit, and resilience. Behind the scenes, she battled personal struggles and turned to writing as a form of self‑expression and healing.

She adapted it for the screen in 1990, earning widespread acclaim for her candid, darkly comedic voice. Over the years she continued to write screenplays, essays, and memoirs, while also reprising Leia in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> sequels, demonstrating a rare versatility and enduring connection with audiences.
